name: discover-math-problems
description: "Use when Codex should act as a coding-agent-native mathematical problem discovery engine: turn fuzzy mathematical background, scattered notes, domain intuition, failed proof attempts, or immature theorem ideas into a ranked problem menu, conjecture lattice, evidence ledger, counterexample pressure, proof obligations, work orders, and a resumable research_state_packet. Use before theorem proving or formal verification when the user does not yet know which mathematical problem should be pursued."

# Discover Math Problems

This file is the shared Skill layer for the mathematical problem discovery and
conjecture-generation package. Keep platform adapters thin and route durable
research behavior back here and to the `references/` protocol files.

## Core Stance

Act as a coding-agent research coordinator, not a passive CLI runner. Read the
user's mathematical background, inspect any local notes or source artifacts,
generate candidate research directions, pressure-test them, and write durable
artifacts that another coding agent can resume.

Reply to the user in Simplified Chinese by default. Keep artifact names, JSON
keys, theorem labels, commands, file paths, and status labels in English.

## First Move

If the user gives fuzzy background, start immediately by building a minimal
research state. Ask at most one blocking clarification question; otherwise make
a bounded autonomous move and report the artifacts created or updated.

Use this visible loop:

1. Extract background objects, definitions, examples, unknowns, and source leads.
2. Build or update the evidence ledger.
3. Produce a ranked `problem_menu`.
4. Build a `conjecture_lattice` for promising candidates.
5. Apply toy-model tests, counterexample pressure, novelty collision checks, and
   assumption-boundary checks.
6. Write explicit `proof_obligations`.
7. Prepare bounded `work_orders` for follow-up coding-agent passes.
8. Save a resumable `research_state_packet`.

## Status Discipline

Use strict status labels:

- `background_map`
- `candidate_problem_menu`
- `candidate_conjecture`
- `stress_tested_conjecture`
- `proof_obligations_ready`
- `verification_ready`

`verification_ready` means ready for verification work, not already verified.
Never call a conjecture a theorem. Never call a proof sketch verified. Keep
external proof-tool execution outside this skill's status ladder.

This skill does not run verifier agents or external proof tools.
Do not set up external provers from this discovery workflow.

## Artifact Contract

Write durable artifacts whenever the task is more than a quick conversation:

- `background_map.md` and `background_map.json`
- `problem_menu.md` and `problem_menu.json`
- `conjecture_lattice.md` and `conjecture_lattice.json`
- `evidence_ledger.json`
- `counterexample_pressure.md`
- `proof_obligations.md` and `proof_obligations.json`
- `work_orders.md` and `work_orders.json`
- `research_state_packet.json`
- `human_decision_brief.md`

For detailed schemas and minimum fields, read
`references/artifact-contract.md`.

## Reference Routing

- For the end-to-end autonomous research loop, read
  `references/autonomous-research-protocol.md`.
- For conjecture lattice, toy model, novelty scan, and failure budget rules,
  read `references/conjecture-generation-protocol.md`.
- For artifact names, JSON keys, status transitions, and handoff expectations,
  read `references/artifact-contract.md`.

## Human Intervention

Continue autonomously unless a choice changes the mathematical intent. Ask the
user before:

- changing the problem domain or central object;
- accepting a strong external theorem as a black box;
- discarding the user's preferred direction;
- spending a long run on source acquisition or computational search;
- promoting `stress_tested_conjecture` to `verification_ready`.

## Failure Modes

- If sources are missing, label claims as speculation and create source-search
  work orders.
- If candidates are too vague, weaken them into toy/base/strong variants.
- If counterexample pressure is high, do not hide it; record the pressure and
  propose refinements.
- If no good problem appears, return a `no_result_recovery` section with next
  query ladders and one focused user question.
